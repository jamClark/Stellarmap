	<h3>Release Notes</h3>
	<p>Because there are two versions of Stellarmap, one for general Dead Souls use and one with Stellarmass-specific features,
	some updates may apply only to one or the other. In such cases the symbols &lt;DS&gt; and &lt;SM&gt; will be used to signify
		which appropriately.

  <h3>June 1, 2010</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mappings can now take arrays as a key. Finally, QCS-generated rooms can be imported without editing!</li>
      <li>Mappings and arrays now perform some extra formatting checks to ensure any trailing commas
        are removed (the parser will choke on it). Unfortunately this means code that was nicely formatted
        by people or QCS will become somewhat mangled after being imported and saved in Stellarmap.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug that would not allow you to move rooms down and to the right when the viewport was scrolled
        too far above and to the left of the origin.</li>
      <li>Probably a few other things over the last couple months that I can't remember now.</li>
    </ul>
    
	<h3>March 20, 2010</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Changed the room properties box so that it uses a list defined in the configuration file</li>
		<li>Added 'login' property for rooms</li>
		<li>&lt;SM&gt; Added 'hospital' property for rooms</li>
		<li>Added function controls for <em>SetTerrainType()</em> and <em>SetMedium()</em> for
			rooms</li>
		<li>Function controls now have the ability to specify an additional header file they
			might require to be included.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug that was causing data to not save correctly</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug with imported rooms clearing their data after selecting a different
			room (at least, I think I fixed it... that is to say.. it just went away magically
			after a couple weeks of not doing anything on this project)</li>
		<li>Fixed another bug that would cause a crash if a room were removed from the project
			(deleted) and then re-imported back in without first saveing and reloading the workspace.</li>
		<li>Fixed item generators so that they properly output their data. Whoops.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>February 20, 2010</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Integrated a spell checker into the basic text editor. Also added the standard cut/copy/paste context menu items.</li>
		<li>text editor is now (approximately) 80 characters wide (getting it spot on is tougher
			than I thought it would be though)</li>
		<li>fixed npc inventory crasher due to bad parameter type</li>
		<li>fixed bad output for vendor storage room due to bad parameter type</li>
		<li>external domains can now have their inventory and room names imported into a workspace.
			Just place the master .XML file in the /assets/domainreferences folder and they
			will show up on the import list</li>
		<li>many internal refactorings of code will hopefully make life easier down the road</li>
		<li>added access to text editor to all textbox-related function controls</li>
		<li>Npcs can now be given points for other languages</li>
		<li>&lt;SM&gt; Added flag to signal if an NPC should drop its inventory on death
			or just destroy it</li>
		<li>&lt;SM&gt; Added a map of item drops rates on npc death</li>
		<li>&lt;SM&gt; Added spacesuit option for armor</li>
		<li>Ok, npc inventories work for real this time</li>
		<li>Added one more encoding choice. A non-signature version of UTF8. Mostly for backwards
			compatibility. It has been set as the default encoding</li>
		<li>fixed a crasher when canceling openning a domain for the first time</li>
		<li>fixed a bug that was causing enters to be mapped to exits</li>
		<li>fixed a bug that could cause a crash when assigning exits or enters to rooms just
			after loading a domain but before selecting any rooms that did not previously have
			exits or enters</li>
		<li>fixed a bug where if a room had multiple exits going to the same desination all
			exits would be removed if any one was removed</li>
		<li>changed item/armor generators' calls from 'SetValue()' to 'SetBaseCost()'</li>
		<li>Added cost generators (however, prices are based on Stellarmass)</li>
		<li>Renaming rooms is difficult and error prone so I took the lazy way out. There are
			now two ways to create a room. The old way (quick) where a name is assigned and the
			new way (slow) where you have to fill in a textbox with the new name</li>
		<li>Added the ability to import items into the workspace. You can now reference them
			in the inventories lists</li>
		<li>Added meals to the generator</li>
		<li>Redesigned the config file to allow arbitrary lists to be added. This allows users
			to define their own custom lists within the config file that can then be accessed
			by the dynamic item generators. I've also appended many default lists from Dead
			Souls that weren't available before including:<em> build types, bodytypes, mouth types,
				vision, resperation types, size types, meal types, mediums, terrain types, motion,</em>
			and <em>booby traps.</em> See the config file for examples of how to add new types
			using the &lt;list&gt; tag</li>
		<li>Added support for multi-parameter dynamic function controls. See <em>inheriteditems.xml</em>
			and the entry for <em>meals</em> for an example</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>February 2, 2010</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Fixed a couple more show stoppers that appeared in the last release due to a bad
		config file for Sentient NPCs. <strong>Be sure to delete any old version of the file
				<em>inheritednpcs.xml</em> so that the new executable can create a new version without
				the errors in it.</strong></li>
		<li>Made the font bigger in the text editor windows for strings. I must be gettin' old</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h3>January 30, 2010</h3>
	<ul><li>The location of the last project you opened or created is now saved in the config
		file</li>
		<li>The currently selected room's name is now displayed above the Domain Map View rather
			than on the room edior panel</li>
		<li>Door generator now creates an array of Ids rather than a single string. It also tries
			to create default ids for most common doors</li>
		<li>Npcs' inventory lists now works</li>
		<li>Added Sentient Npcs (LIB_SENTIENT), Vendors, Barkeeps to the NPC generator</li>
		<li>Added support for text file encoding/decoding choice (found in Domain Options in
			the menu)</li>
		<li>Added support for line ending choice (found in Domain Options in the menu)</li>
		<li>Removed some of the features that were relevant only to our mud (firearms and ammo
			generators)</li>
		<li>There are now two disinct binaries generated. One with Stellarmass-only features
			and one for general Dead Souls users</li>
		<li>&lt;SM&gt; Added 'mechs allowed' property to rooms</li>
		<li>&lt;DS&gt; Removed the native Windows API call to MessageBeep(). Hopefully this
			will make Stellarmap more Mono compatible</li>
		<li>Found and fixed a couple show stoppers in the function controls used for processing
			mappings.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
