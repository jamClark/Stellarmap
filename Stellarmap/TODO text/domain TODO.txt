Domain TODO:

-Editable room names (needs to update Imagebox and model)
-Editing roomnames needs to update the exits and enters list as well as the function controls
-there are a Finite ammount of room names with no ability to recover unused previous names.
-::create() in rooms is occasionally getting parameters passed to it somehow


-Autoscroll when dragging a room near the edge of the viewport
-handle lost focus for the statemachine to return to default state
-Tooltips display roomnames in the domain viewport


-LPC objects:
	-restaurant, inventory, needs access to the list of imported (and working) items, NPCs and mobs.
	

-Code Parser



MAJOR BUGS:

-Can't keep selectionrect while drag scrolling
	!needs a state transition from Selected to Scrolling


MINOR BUGS:

-When multiple rooms are selected the context menu for deleteing a room does nothing.
