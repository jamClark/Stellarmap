Most inanimate objects inherit from the LIB_ITEM library in dead souls. As a result, they share many features in common. The item generator places the most common elements in the first three tabs labeled: General, Properties, and Weapon Stats; and leaves the final tab Inherited Features open for expansions. In this way, objects that derive from items but have unique functionality can be defined in the configuration files and the additional features can be presented in the menus and Inherited Features tab automatically.
