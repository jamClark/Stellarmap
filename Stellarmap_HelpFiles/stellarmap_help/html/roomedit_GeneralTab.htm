<p>
This tab consists of several basic properties that should be set for all rooms. Most
of these properties are presentational in manner and have little mechanical value in terms of gameplay.
</p>


<h3>Room Name</h3>
<p>
<i>SetShort(string)</i><br /><br />
The title of the room that appears at the top of the description when the player enters. Can take a string or a value escaped with $.
</p><br />

<h3>Light</h3>
<p>
<i>SetLight(int) or SetProperty("light",int)</i><br /><br />
Represents the brightness of a room. Default value is 30. For stellarmass
anything below 20 is considered low-light and anything below 12 is near pitch black.
As well, anything over 50 is over-bright.
</p><br />

<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>
<i>SetClimate(string)</i><br /><br />
Sets the weather patterns for the room. Items are loaded from the configuration file.
</p><br />

<h3>Long Description</h3>
<p>
<i>SetLong(string)</i><br /><br />
The detailed description of the room. Viewed when the player first enters the room (if player has long descriptions turn on) or when using the <i>look</i> command.
</p><br />

<h3>Enable Day/Night</h3>
<p>
<i>n/a</i><br /><br />
This is just a switch to enable or disable the text boxes for Day and Night long descriptions. It does not generate any code for itself but instead allows <i>SetDayLong()</i> and <i>SetNightLong()</i> to be output to the file when saved.
</p><br />

<h3>Day Description</h3>
<p>
<i>SetDayLong(string)</i><br /><br />
An alternate to <i>SetLong()</i> that is to be used in tandem with <i>SetNightLong()</i>. It sets the long description to be displayed during the daytime. Only works for rooms with a climate set to something other than <i>indoors</i>.
</p><br />

<h3>Night Description</h3>
<p>
<i>SetNightLong(string)</i><br /><br />
An alternate to <i>SetLong()</i> that is to be used in tandem with <i>SetDayLong()</i>. It sets the long descriptio to be displayed during the night time. Only works for rooms with a climate set to something other than <i>indoors</i>.
</p><br />

<h3>Icon</h3>
<p>
<i>n/a</i><br /><br />
Chooses the icon to display on the room in the map domain view. This does have any effect on the code generated for this room.
