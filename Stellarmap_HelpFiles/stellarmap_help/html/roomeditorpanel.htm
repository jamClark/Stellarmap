<h1>Room Editor Panel</h1>
<p>
Here you can edit many of the settings used in basic rooms. Some controls provide drop down menus that are filled out automagically when objects are imported into the project (such as items and doors).
<br />
<br />
Most controls correspond directly with a function call built into the 'room.c' object. For more details please see the builders guide to rooms that is provided with Dead Souls. You can view it here <a href="http://dead-souls.net/docs/build/">http://dead-souls.net/docs/build/</a>.
