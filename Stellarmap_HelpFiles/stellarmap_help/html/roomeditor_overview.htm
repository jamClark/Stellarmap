<h1>The Room Editor</h1>
<p>
The room editor is where you will spend a majority of your time when editing areas. Everything that cannot be edited in the domain map viewer will be done here instead. Information will be synched between the two so that exits, doors, and room icons will match the settings found in the room editor pane.
<br />
<br />
The room editor pane is found just left of the map view domain and consists of five tabs; General, Content, Rooms Details, Exits and properties.
