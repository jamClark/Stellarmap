<h1>Domain Map Viewer</h1>
<img src="../img/map1.PNG" alt="map view" />
<p>This is the heart and soul of domain layouts. Each room in your file can be placed here to visually indicate where it lies in logical correlation to your domain. Rooms can be created, removed, connected to each other, and moved around using the mouse and keyboard.

<h3>The Compass</h3>
