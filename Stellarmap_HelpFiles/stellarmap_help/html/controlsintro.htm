<h1>Customize Your Item Generator!</h1>
<p>
<h3>Wanna Make Your Editor Even Better?</h3>
Item generators are neat. They can pound out code in no time flat and without all that spell checking hassle. However, chances are good that many developers have created custom objects that don't fit into the typical settings these default  generators provide. Luckily, Stellarmap was designed around this assumption and so exntention is a major feature!
<br />
<br />
Of course, this only works for items derived from LIB_ITEM or LIB_ARMOR because many controls are also designed to tailor to the most common default functions that must exist within all such objects. However, aside from that small caveat, nearly everything else has the sky for the limit! Well, almost.

<h3>Function Controls</h3>
Functions controls are specialized controls used to automatically convert their input into parameters for Dead Souls object functions. They were a powerful tool in developing Stellarmap and that power has been slightly extended to the user. Each control represents a single function call with a single parameter. The type of control used is based on the designer's choice of what best represents the data. It may be a text box, a list of check boxes, or even a double set of drop-down combo boxes. All that needs to be done is to edit the 'itemconfig.xml' file located in the assets directory and viola! Instant new items! No recompiling. No mess.
