<h1>Introduction</h1>
The appeal of Dead Souls as a mudlib is primarily from its use of LPC to define all of its objects. While this allows creators the ultimate in flexibility it can be a slow and tedious process to code every little thing by hand and worst of all it can be very error prone. A built in command line editor known as QCS is supplied with Dead Souls to help alleviate these problems, however, it suffers the same trouble of users being required to remember dozens of commands and typing them out one by one.  QCS also does not offer a trulely holistic view of a domain project.
<br /><br />
Stellarmap was a project started for the Stellarmass mud built using Dead Souls. It is a visual editor designed to allow creators a complete view of their domain project. It provides a visual designer for laying out rooms, editing their contents, and connecting them to one another. Generators are also provided for common objects such as items, doors, weapons, food, and npcs which are all automatically imported into the domain project workspace where they can be inserted into the rooms being edited.
<br /><br />
While it can't compose complex instructions or unique features Stellarmap is quite useful for pounding out basic room layouts and generating most common items that will be used in them.
<br /><br />
Side Note: (<B>WARNING</B>: Beta Quaility Feature) Stellarmap was designed to ignore code that it does not understand or utilize so it should be safe to import highly specialized rooms and still adjust them in the editor.
