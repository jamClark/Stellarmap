<h1>Required Modifications for Dead Souls</h1>
<p>
It was the goal to avoid requiring any special modifications to Dead Souls in order for Stellarmap to work with it, however in certain cases Stellarmap can be more effective by making quick and simple changes in order to smooth things out between the two.
<br />
<br />
Due to the nature of the controls developed for Stellarmap it can be quite tricky to always get the desired result for the matching function calls in the objects being generated. A good example is the armor generator. In Dead Souls the functions for setting armor protections were a tad limited. It requires several calls to <i>SetProtection()</i> with different parameters each time. While this functionality is feasable the result looks rather contrived and isn't very intuitive for the user (just look at the door generator). A simple map-based list worked quite well and it is much easier to add one additional and simple function to the <i>base_armors.c</i> file than to create a specialized control for just this one use.

<h3>Future Changes</h3>
As of yet, there are no major changes or addons required for Dead Souls. However, in the future there may be support for uploading of domains and dowloading of other creators workspace information. At such a time any required modifications will be provided here and will most like come in the form of some kind of addon.
